This study aimed at determining the frequency of ESBL genes in multidrug resistant human clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Edo state Nigeria and to characterize the resistance mechanisms.A total of 218 consecutive clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, selection based on inclusion criteria, were collected from March-May 2015 from three medical microbiology laboratories of hospitals in Edo state Nigeria. All isolates were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer method and minimum inhibitory concentration determination by E-test method. Double disc synergy test was used to screen for the production of ESBL. Whole genome sequencing was performed for isolate characterization and identification of resistance determinants.Out of 218 consecutive clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 149 were multi-drug resistant. Of these multi-drug resistant isolates, 61 were positive for the ESBL phenotypic test and had ESBL genes detected. CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL found, among 93.4 percent. The plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnrB, qnrS oqxAB, qepA and aac6-lb-cr were detected in 90.2 percent ESBL isolates. Twenty eight plasmid incompatibility groups and 28 known and six new sequence types were identified among the ESBL isolates.In conclusion this study shows that ESBLs are frequently associated with other resistance determinants in multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates in Nigeria.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available."

During this investigation a previously undetected Streptococcus in fur animals was also found on many samples, especially from mink. It was suspected that the Streptococcus together with a few other bacteria might contribute to the disease. The Streptococcus was identified as Streptococcus halichoeri. At the same time period Finnish pet dogs were afflicted with an ear infection with poor treatment response. S. halichoeri was isolated from the samples.

Acetaldehyde (AcH) is produced during ethanol metabolism mediated by intestinal bacteria and colorectal mucosal cells. AcH associated with alcohol consumption is a potential risk factor for alcohol-related digestive tract cancers such as those of the esophagus, colon, or rectum. The role of intestinal bacteria in the accumulation of carcinogenic AcH in the colon and rectum after drinking has been implicated, although its ecophysiological details remain to be clarified. Because colorectal cancer develops from mucosal cells, the populations of AcH-accumulating bacteria inhabiting the colorectal mucosal surface may play a key role in alcohol-related colorectal cancer pathogenesis. We examined the ability of bacterial isolates from feces of alcoholic patients to produce and decompose AcH and identified various microorganisms that potentially accumulate AcH in the colon and rectum. These were collectively referred to as potential AcH accumulators (PAAs) . Among the PAA strains identified, we discovered a bacterial strain, C5-48T, which careful its taxonomic characteristics is similar to the known species of Clostridium but similarity values of the 16S rDNA is low.
