Previous studies indicated a number of potent virulence factors of Porphyromonas gingivalis such as cysteine proteinase, gingipains and fimbria. From genomic information of P. gingivalis, we found a novel secretion system (type IX secretion system) that translocate virulence factors to cell surface. It suggested that the genomic information was indispensable to elucidate virulence factors in other periodontal pathogens. This project try to determine the whole genome sequence of periodontal pathogens, then to elucidate there pathogenicity comprehensively."

Three isolates were discovered from skin lesions of a severe cellular immunodeficiency patient, an immunocompetent patient and a patient treated with biologic. Genotypic analysis using 16S rRNA misidentified this isolate as M. simiae. However, multiple gene analysis using the internal transcribed spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes, and the rpoB and hsp65 genes revealed the presence of a novel mycobacterium. The antimicrobial susceptibility of this isolate was completely different from that of M. simiae. On the basis of these findings, we propose naming this new species Mycobacterium shigaense sp. nov."

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available."
