All strains reported here were isolated from powdered infant formula obtained as part of routine microbial regulatory monitoring. Strains Cr150 and Cr170 were isolated in 2007, and strain Cr611 was isolated in 2013. Isolates were detected according to ISO-22964 (Microbiology of the food chain horizontal method for the detection of Cronobacter spp.). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and standard biochemical analysis indicate that the three strains belong to the Cronobacter sakazakii group. Using advanced bioinformatics analyses we show that their genomes represent new members in the C. sakazakii, C. muytjensii and C. turicensis groups.","JABWGS010000010,JABWGS010000011,JABWGS010000012,JABWGS010000013,JABWGS010000014,JABWGS010000015,JABWGS010000016",413501

Acetaldehyde (AcH) is produced during ethanol metabolism mediated by intestinal bacteria and colorectal mucosal cells. AcH associated with alcohol consumption is a potential risk factor for alcohol-related digestive tract cancers such as those of the esophagus, colon, or rectum. The role of intestinal bacteria in the accumulation of carcinogenic AcH in the colon and rectum after drinking has been implicated, although its ecophysiological details remain to be clarified. Because colorectal cancer develops from mucosal cells, the populations of AcH-accumulating bacteria inhabiting the colorectal mucosal surface may play a key role in alcohol-related colorectal cancer pathogenesis. We examined the ability of bacterial isolates from feces of alcoholic patients to produce and decompose AcH and identified various microorganisms that potentially accumulate AcH in the colon and rectum. These were collectively referred to as potential AcH accumulators (PAAs) . Among the PAA strains identified, we discovered a bacterial strain, C5-48T, which careful its taxonomic characteristics is similar to the known species of Clostridium but similarity values of the 16S rDNA is low. As a part of investigation of the physiological function of this strain, we performed whole genome sequence analysis of this strain.",BLTJ01000000,2547410

With funding support from FDAâ€™s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","JABRWM010000006,JABRWM010000001,JABRWM010000002,JABRWM010000003,JABRWM010000004,JABRWM010000005,JABRWM010000007",648995

All isolates were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer method and minimum inhibitory concentration determination by E-test method. Double disc synergy test was used to screen for the production of ESBL. Whole genome sequencing was performed for isolate characterization and identification of resistance determinants.Out of 218 consecutive clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 149 were multi-drug resistant. Of these multi-drug resistant isolates, 61 were positive for the ESBL phenotypic test and had ESBL genes detected. CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL found, among 93.4 percent.
