Treatment of these pathogens has become a major challenge to all clinicians worldwide. Huge revenue and technology is also being dedicated towards developing novel drugs and antibiotic combinations to combat resistance. Addressing the above issue, we have constructed a panel of strains of Acinetobacter sp. expressing different resistances such as narrow spectrum β-lactamase and oxacillinase, ESBL, OXA-carbapenemase, MBL and over producing AmpC, and genotypically characterized them to understand their resistance mechanism.MethodsAll the bacterial strains exhibiting different resistance phenotypes were collected according to the diagnostic decision tree based on phenotypic observation mentioned in Courvalin, P., et al. Antibiogram, during the period 2008-2013 from Severance hospital, Seoul. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to the CLSI guidelines using agar dilution method. Selected strains were sequenced using Ion Torrent PGM system, annotated using RAST server and analyzed using Geneious pro 8.0.ResultsGenotypic determinants i.e. acquired resistance genes, mutations and porin alternations contributing to the relevant expressed phenotype was characterized using massive parallel technology. The complete resistance mechanisms for the collected reference strains were determined. Due to the acquisition of multiple resistance genes and transposons, the diagnostic decision tree for evaluating the resistance is not accurate, which alarms the urgent need for modification to this scheme.ConclusionThe complete illustrated mechanism contributing to specific resistance phenotypes can be used as a target for the novel drug development. These strains can be used as a reference strain in the clinical laboratory and also in evaluating the anti-microbial drug efficiency for specific resistance. Similar work can also be performed in other species/genus to understand the mechanism and control the associated infections.",MKHH01000000,106654

We sought to investigate whether the M. catarrhalis strain is variable between COPD subjects; that an exacerbation is associated with acquisition of a new strain and that certain strains are more commonly associated with exacerbations.Patients and methods: Sputum samples were collected at stable and exacerbation visits from COPD subjects from a single centre as part of the COPDMAP consortium. Samples identified as M. catarrhalis positive by qPCR were re-cultured in liquid cultures grown to extract genomic DNA; underwent Illumina MiSeq and bacterial genome sequences were de novo assembled and Multi Locus Sequence Type (MLST) was determined.Results: 35 samples were obtained from 18 subjects. These included 13 stable and 22 exacerbation samples. The diversity between samples was very large with 25 different M. catarrhalis MLSTs identified out of the 35 samples of which 12 MSLTs have not been described previously. Change and persistence of M. catarrhalis strain were observed between stable visits, from stable to exacerbation and vice-a-versa, and between exacerbation visits.Conclusion: Sputum M. catarrhalis strains exhibit marked diversity within and between COPD subjects. Acquisition of a new strain is common between stable and between stable and exacerbation events such that no strain is specifically associated with an exacerbation.",QZHT01000000,480

This upsurge was associated with a specific oxa23-positive clone that was identified by multilocus VNTR analysis. Here, we used whole-genome sequence analysis to dissect the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICU during 2009–2012. To provide historical context and distinguish microevolution from strain introduction, we compared these genomes with those of A. baumannii asymptomatic carriage and VAP isolates from this same ICU collected during 2003–2007. We identified diverse lineages co-circulating over many years. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of oxa23, oxa40, oxa58 and ndm1 genes in multiple lineages. The majority of resistant isolates were oxa23-positive global clone GC2; fine-scale phylogenomic analysis revealed five distinct GC2 sublineages within the ICU that had evolved locally via independent chromosomal insertions of oxa23 transposons. The increase in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was associated with transposon-mediated transmission of a carbapenemase gene, rather than clonal expansion or spread of a carbapenemase-harbouring plasmid. Additionally, we found evidence of homologous recombination creating diversity within the local GC2 population, including several events resulting in replacement of the capsule locus. We identified likely donors of the imported capsule locus sequences amongst the A. baumannii isolated on the same ward, suggesting that diversification was largely facilitated via reassortment and sharing of genetic material within the localized A. baumannii population. http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/bacteria/ This data is part of a pre-publication release.

Among the organisms involved in these infections, bacteria from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) are often associated with poor clinical prognosis. This study examines how the most prevalent BCC species among CF patients, B. multivorans, evolves within a CF patient and identifies mutations underlying antibiotic resistance and adaptation to both the native CF lung and a non-CF lung allograft. We demonstrate that B. multivorans can diversify phenotypically and genetically within the CF lung, with a complex population structure underlying a chronic infection We noted that isolates collected after the patient was re-infected post-transplant were more closely related to descendants of the incident clone than to those recovered in the weeks prior to transplant. We used a genome-wide association method to identify genes associated with resistance to the β-lactam antibiotics: aztreonam and ceftazidime. Many of these variants were found in regions that show patterns of recombination (genetic exchange) between strains. We also found that genes which were mutated multiple times during overall infection were more likely to be found in regions showing signals consistent with recombination. The presence of multiple independent mutations in a gene is a very strong signal that the gene helps bacteria adapt to their environment. Overall, this study provides insight into how pathogens adapt to the host during long-term infections, specific genes associated with antibiotic resistance, and the origin of new and recurrent infections.",QLCW01000000,87883

The primary cause of CF-related deaths is chronic microbial infection in the lungs of affected patients. In particular, bacterial pathogens from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) are a serious health concern for CF patients, because Bcc can establish persistent infections in the lungs and are highly resistant to antibiotics. Complicating the clinical picture is the fact that CF patients infected with the “same” Burkholderia strains, as identified by the lower-resolution genotyping methods, can have drastically different clinical outcomes. In this study, we sequenced over 200 clinical isolates of B. cenocepacia using Illumina paired-end and PacBio long-read sequencing.

There are two biovariants of C. trachomatis: trachoma and lyphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Trachoma isolates are non-invasive, whereas the LGV strains are invasive causing a disseminating infection of the local draining lymph nodes. Genome analysis has shown that the ocular and the genital trachoma isolates are 99.6 % identical at the sequence level and only show small differences in overall gene content. However, differences in coding potential, and the loss of function through point mutation, have been used to subdivide the trachoma strains into those associated with ocular and genital infections. We have previously sequenced a two LGV isolates; a long-term laboratory passaged strain and the recent ‘epidemic’ clinical LGV isolate causing proctitis. From these strains it was evident that there were no whole gene differences and that the recent epidemic isolate was a classical LGV isolate and has been circulating in the human population for a long time: an old strain causing a new disease. We have now put together a global collection of LGV isolates and are a sequencing them to determine the global phylogeny of this pathogen.. This data is part of a pre-publication release.

Integrative analysis of in vitro gene essentiality and mutation rates enabled the identification of several putative virulence factors and antigenic proteins; revealing recombination machinery, glycerol metabolism and peroxide production as possible factors in the genetics and physiology of these pathogenic strains. Additionally, the transcriptomes and proteomes of two representative strains, one from each of the two main groups, have been characterized to evaluate the impact of mutations on RNA and proteins levels.

Pubmed ID: 25038069. Staphylococcus haemolyticus is an emerging cause of nosocomial infections, primarily affecting immunocompromised patients. A comparative genomic analysis was performed on clinical S. haemolyticus isolates to investigate their genetic relationship and explore the coding sequences with respect to antimicrobial resistance determinants and putative hospital adaptation. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 134 isolates of S. haemolyticus from geographically diverse origins (Belgium, 2; Germany, 10; Japan, 13; Norway, 54; Spain, 2; Switzerland, 43; UK, 9; USA, 1). Each genome was individually assembled. Protein coding sequences (CDSs) were predicted and homologous genes were categorized into three types: Type I, core genes, homologues present in all strains; Type II, unique core genes, homologues shared by only a subgroup of strains; and Type III, unique genes, strain-specific CDSs. The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates was built from variable sites in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome and used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogeny. SNPs in the genome core regions divided the isolates into one major group of 126 isolates and one minor group of isolates with highly diverse genomes. The major group was further subdivided into seven clades (A-G), of which four (A-D) encompassed isolates only from Europe. Antimicrobial multiresistance was observed in 77.7% of the collection. High levels of homologous recombination were detected in genes involved in adherence, staphylococcal host adaptation and bacterial cell communication. The presence of several successful and highly resistant clones underlines the adaptive potential of this opportunistic pathogen.",CUHB01000000,1283

Bordetella pertussis causes pertussis, a respiratory disease that is most severe for infants. Vaccination was introduced in the 1950s, and in recent years, a resurgence of disease was observed worldwide, with significant mortality in infants. Possible causes for this include the switch from whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) to less effective acellular vaccines (ACVs), waning immunity, and pathogen adaptation. Pathogen adaptation is suggested by antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains and by the emergence of strains with increased pertussis toxin production. We applied comparative genomics to a worldwide collection of 343 B. pertussis strains isolated between 1920 and 2010. The global phylogeny showed two deep branches; the largest of these contained 98% of all strains, and its expansion correlated temporally with the first descriptions of pertussis outbreaks in Europe in the 16th century. We found little evidence of recent geographical clustering of the strains within this lineage, suggesting rapid strain flow between countries. We observed that changes in genes encoding proteins implicated in protective immunity that are included in ACVs occurred after the introduction of WCVs but before the switch to ACVs. Furthermore, our analyses consistently suggested that virulence-associated genes and genes coding for surface-exposed proteins were involved in adaptation. However, many of the putative adaptive loci identified have a physiological role, and further studies of these loci may reveal less obvious ways in which B. pertussis and the host interact. This work provides insight into ways in which pathogens may adapt to vaccination and suggests ways to improve pertussis vaccines. Whooping cough is mainly caused by Bordetella pertussis, and current vaccines are targeted against this organism. Recently, there have been increasing outbreaks of whooping cough, even where vaccine coverage is high. Analysis of the genomes of 343 B. pertussis isolates from around the world over the last 100 years suggests that the organism has emerged within the last 500 years, consistent with historical records. We show that global transmission of new strains is very rapid and that the worldwide population of B. pertussis is evolving in response to vaccine introduction, potentially enabling vaccine escape.",CSSR01000000,520

GBS can be classified into ten distinct serotypes differing in the chemical composition of the capsular polysaccharide. However, non-typeable strains that do not react with anti-capsular sera are frequently isolated from colonized and infected humans and cattle. To obtain a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis for the loss of capsule expression in GBS, a collection of well-characterized non-typeable strains was investigated by genome sequencing. Genome based phylogenetic analysis extended to a wide population of sequenced strains confirmed the recently observed high clonality among GBS lineages mainly containing human strains, and revealed a much higher degree of diversity in the bovine population. Remarkably, non-typeable strains were equally distributed in all lineages. A number of distinct mutations in the cps operon were identified that were apparently responsible for inactivation of capsule synthesis. The most frequent genetic alterations were point mutations leading to stop codons in the cps genes, and the main target was found to be cpsE encoding the portal glycosyl trasferase of capsule biosynthesis. Complementation of strains carrying missense mutations in cpsE with a wild-type gene restored capsule expression allowing the identification of amino acid residues essential for enzyme activity.",LDAG01000000,1311

Here, we show that Iisolates associated with disease contained substantially fewer genes than non-clinical isolates, but were are more likely to encode virulence factors. Human disease isolates were are limited to a single virulent population, originating in the 1920s when pig production was intensified, but no consistent genomic differences between pig and human isolates were are observed. There was is little geographical clustering of different S. suis sub-populations, and the bacterium undergoes high rates of recombination, implying that an increase in virulence anywhere in the world could have a global impact over a short timescale.",CDTM01000000,1307
