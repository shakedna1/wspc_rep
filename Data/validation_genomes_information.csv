Risk factors for NTM pulmonary disease include prior TB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, occupational lung disease etc. The important feature of NTM infection is, essentially all NTMs are resistant to all first-line anti TB drugs and to some second-line injectables. Another aspect is NTM infections initially are treated as TB and are correctly diagnosed very late during the deterioration stage.

Although L. crispatus is often present at low frequencies in the BV vaginal microbiome, it apparently cannot become dominant in the population, as in a healthy microbiome.

The disease is caused by microbial biofilms in the middle ear, which trigger the release of effusion fluid. The portal of entry for bacteria to reach the middle ear is not well understood. One possibility is that bacteria transcend the eustacian tube from the adenoids. Here, we isolated strains of Streptococcus spp. from paired middle ear effusion fluid and adenoid samples of two patients. The paired samples from each patient were identified as the same species by MALDI-TOF. In one case, paired isolates were classified as S. oralis, and in the other the isolates were both S. parasanguinis.

Currently, the majority of epidemic cholera reported globally is El Tor biotype Vibrio cholerae isolates of the serogroup O1. However, in Bangladesh, outbreaks attributed to V. cholerae serogroup O139 isolates, which fall within the same phylogenetic lineage as the O1 serogroup isolates, were seen between 1992 and 1993 and in 2002 to 2005. Since then, V. cholerae serogroup O139 has only been sporadically isolated in Bangladesh and is now rarely isolated elsewhere. METHODS: Here, we present case histories of four cholera patients infected with V. cholerae serogroup O139 in 2013 and 2014 in Bangladesh. We comprehensively typed these isolates using conventional approaches, as well as by whole genome sequencing. Phenotypic typing and PCR confirmed all four isolates belonging to the O139 serogroup. FINDINGS: Whole genome sequencing revealed that three of the isolates were phylogenetically closely related to previously sequenced El Tor biotype, pandemic 7, toxigenic V. cholerae O139 isolates originating from Bangladesh and elsewhere. The fourth isolate was a non-toxigenic V. cholerae that, by conventional approaches, typed as O139 serogroup but was genetically divergent from previously sequenced pandemic 7 V. cholerae lineages belonging to the O139 or O1 serogroups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that previously observed lineages of V. cholerae O139 persist in Bangladesh and can cause clinical disease and that a novel disease-causing non-toxigenic O139 isolate also occurs.
